      <h1>Customer Service</h1>

      <div class="secy">
          <h2>Delivery</h2>
          <p>We use <strong>DPD</strong> to deliver your order as fast as possible. (Your order will be dispatched within 24-48 hours. We will send you tracking information as soon as your package leaves our depot (always check for spam and trash can).</p>
          <p>We also deliver on Saturdays. You can follow your package with your tracking number via the <strong>DPD website</strong>. Would you like to know more? See our preview with <a href="#">all shipping information</a>. The delivery time is an indication, we cannot guarantee it.</p>
          <p>Deliveries to post office boxes and packing stations are not possible.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="secy">
          <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
          <p>We ship your order for a fixed amount, regardless of the size of your order.</p>
          <p>Why no free shipping for larger orders? Free shipping does not exist; if it is offered, it is part of the cost price of the plants, making each individual plant more expensive. You would pay more shipping on larger orders, even when it seems to be for free.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="secy">
          <h2>Delivery Height</h2>
          <p>The photos on this site are for illustrative purposes only. All perennials (annuals - biennials), shrubs, and trees are delivered in disposable plastic pots.</p>
          <p>We state a delivery height for all pot plants, shrubs, and trees.</p>
          <p>For potted plants, this height is measured from the ground, including the pot. Keep in mind that plants that are planted in a border will be lower in the border because the pot height disappears under the ground.</p>
          <p>Shrubs and trees supplied with bare roots, i.e., without a pot, are measured from the top of the roots and are therefore planted at the same height as the live height.</p>
          <p>We always indicate a delivery height range because it is a live product, and products can vary slightly in length during the season.</p>
          <p>Once planted, most plants will continue to grow quickly, especially in the spring.</p>
          <p>Root plants do not have a delivery height because this part of the perennial disappears completely underground; the plant sprouts after planting.</p>

      <div class="secy">
        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>Due to the perishable nature of the product, the distance and the cost of returning the product, it generally does not make sense to return the product. If you have a problem with any of the products provided, Contact and we will solve it to your satisfaction.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="secy">
        <h2>contact</h2>
        <p>You can contact us by e - Email  7/7 from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, we aim to respond within 48hrs.</p>
        <p>Why only email?
          Email is the most efficient way for us to handle customer inquiries at this time of the season and allows us to help you faster and better than over the phone.</p>
         <p>Important:</p>
          <p>
          Always include your order number in the subject line of the email when you send an email about your order.
          In case of a complaint always enclose a photo of the product(s) to which the complaint relates so that we can immediately handle the complaint to everyone's satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Due to the large volume in the spring (1/3-30/6), we can only process order-related emails during this period.</p>
